# banking-cpp-project

Celebrating its 10-year anniversary, I am excited to open-source my Class 12 Computer Science Project developed during the 2012-2013 academic year.

This project was created with the goal of fostering a love for programming and learning, which is why all code was written from scratch in C++.

Please note that some code and graphics libraries used in this project may be outdated. (More on how to run will be updated here with screenshots)
